This repo is for the Elliot Electric Supply coding interview. Take home deadline is Friday, August 1, 2025.

## Environment Setup

I set up the coding environment in VS Code, for the JUnit tests I used the JUnit 5 library. I downloaded [junit-platform-console-standalone-1.13.4.jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/junit/platform/junit-platform-console-standalone/1.13.4/) and manually placed it in the `lib` folder. The `build_and_run.sh` script compiles the Java files and runs the main class.
